tBeat is a simple iphone app that allows you to tweet what is currently playing in the iPod application.

In addition to tweeting the current beat, it also puts together a shortened YouTube link where your friends listen to the beat you just tweeted!

This is the first of many and frequent releases. 

Upcoming releases will include new and improved features including:
* Allowing you to change the associated twitter account
* Let you choose the beat to tweet instead of only the currently playing beat
* Making editing of the tweet to be sent possible
* Allowing the choice of sending a short link to the beat on Spotify instead of YouTube

Stay tuned!
